### TODO

Try to understand the code in the [payroll](src/main/java/payroll) folder and extend it so the following is achieved:

1. Add a `swagger` file to provide documentation for the API clients
  Note: *you can find step by step instructions [here](https://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api)*

### Solution

You can find the solution in the brach salary:

`git checkout salary`
